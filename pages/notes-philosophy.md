## Why choose work & life classify?

The hard truth is, we're spending the most time of life to work.[^as-non-work-flow] During this time, solving business problems is the main subject.

## Persistent store

Considered working business, the part of working should not be open-source, they deserved a private repository.

Then you should take care avoiding the [wrong second brain](1198-wrong-second-brain), because notes should not be your trash inbox, which always make your system growing up, with high entropy increases, until they being a black hole.

So dealing problem with project is the main subject for this notes, which should have a certain deadline.

## PKM announcement: Soft rules

Whatever you're using, the half life of something (such as rules) is not changed fast. I would try my best to build it to a evergreen tree. [^maintain-soft-rules]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using syntax sugar as less as possible.

Such like `macros` / `properties::` / `org-mode` / `task management` on logseq, `wikitext` / `embed tweet/youtube as image` on obsidian as well.

### Page naming

- Use `-` to connect two word rather blank for **readable url**.
- Use plural of noun to separate different pages
	- using `book` to talk something topic.
	- using `books/xxx` to talk something specific.
- Don't add the `[[]]` in `page_name`
- Never renaming page name after `git commit`.
	- the pain of renaming on git is high, which means the history would be lost at all.

### Properties

Keep order, dictionary order is the best.

### Template

- Every main topic page should have a template.
- All template properties should extend `page`.
	- Keep adding less properties as much as possible.

### Tags

Using `#[[]]` instead of `#`. They would be popped menu friendly, while editing again.

### Hierarchy

Hierarchy/Namespace is not silver bullet. Delay your use of namespaces until you have refined your understanding of how they might suit your workflows. [^namespace-usage]

## What should I not to do

1. The link should not show on title, they would brother others.

[^as-non-work-flow]: If you are a student, or someone else, the work could be something you worked for living. Whether they should separate with space time, there are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand people's eyes. At least in China, space time always conflicts with work, so talking about that is always ambiguous...
[^maintain-soft-rules]: Maybe the flow you have to change in next version, or the problem maybe solved, it's really not have too much value.
