# Hello World

Welcome my second brain build with [[obsidian]] & [[jackyzha0-quartz|quartz]]. I used to build with [[logseq-logseq|logseq]] before, but now I [[1218-giving-up-logseq|Giving up Logseq]] , which is the reason why some part of notes is ugly and wired.[^giving-up-logseq]

Anyway, wish you have a fun time, with following categories by [[notes-philosophy|my category philosophy]]

That would be my pleasure. 😊

## Preface

Before you review, you should know some tips about notes:

1. Most of them is written by outline, so the meaning crossing of headings is unnatural, even wired sometimes. So please read outline before reading it.
2. The language and style of notes are not consistent, which means based on the English / Chinese / Japanese, I'm doing this right now. You could review the reason in [[20260204-before#中文翻译计划|here]].

> [!TIP]
> 在你阅读之前，你应该知道关于笔记的这些建议：
>
> 1. 大部分笔记前身都是大纲结构，这意味着跨标题之间的语义过度是不自然，甚至是奇怪的， 因此在阅读之前，请你浏览先笔记目录。
> 2. 笔记的语言和风格没有一致性，这意味着这篇笔记可能是英文、中文、日语组成的，我正在做这方面的努力，尽量做到一致性。你能在这找到 [[20260204-before#中文翻译计划|原因]]。
