# 反乌托邦

常被用来形容可怕的社会；反乌托邦社会的典型主题包括：通过使用宣传、重度审查信息或否认自由思想、崇拜无法达成的目标、完全失去个性，以及强制遵从等手段完全控制一个社会中的人民

> In English, the term "dystopia" is used to describe a society or community that is oppressive, controlled, or unpleasant, especially one that is imagined or projected into the future. Dystopias are often characterized by poverty, suffering, and lack of individual freedom.
> Examples of dystopias in literature and media include George Orwell's "1984," Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World," and the "Hunger Games" series.
> The opposite of a dystopia is a utopia, which is a society or community that is perfect or ideal in some way.
> So in English, the term "anti-utopia" or "anti-dystopia" can be used to describe something that is opposed to or critical of the idea of a utopian society.
