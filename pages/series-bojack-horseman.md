> "You're a good person，Dlane，and that's the most important thing，it's important that you don't stop being good.I like how you always bring your own bags to the grocery store，and how you're always organized to go places，I like how you chew gum on the airplane so your ears will pop.A lot of people might not appreciate that about you，but 1do.
