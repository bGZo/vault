An acronym for "Prioritize by Organizing, Streamlining, Economizing and Contributing"

Inherent in the acronym is a hierarchy of self-realization, which mirrors [[needs/hierarchy]].

- **P**rioritize your time and mark: your life by goals. 优先考虑您的时间，并通过目标定义您的生活。
- **O**rganize things you have to accomplish regularly to be successful (family and finances). 组织您必须定期完成的事情才能取得成功（家庭和财务）。
- **S**treamline things you may not like to do, but must do (work and chores). 简化您可能不喜欢做的事情，但必须做（工作和杂务）。
- **E**conomize things you should do or may even like to do, but they're not pressingly urgent (pastimes and socializing). 节省您应该做甚至可能要做的事情，但它们并不紧迫（消遣和社交）。
- **C**ontribute by paying attention to the few remaining things that make a difference (social obligations). 通过关注剩下的几个有所不同的事物（社会义务）来做出贡献。
