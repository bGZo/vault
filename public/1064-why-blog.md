## Remember[^memory-disappear]

[^memory-disappear]: 表達欲是有窗口期的，很多不願忘記的想法和感受，就得馬上寫下來，要不然過段時間回憶不起來會更加難受。但表達總是有成本的，各個記錄的媒介代價不一，文字，錄音，照片，影像，甚至是現在的 AI 每種媒介都有自己的分野，側重點不同。我比較古板，還是喜歡寫文章，因爲它幾乎是所有媒介剔骨去肉留下的最終產物。

After I read The Little Prince, I relieved I've forgotten for a long time about rite. But it's seem like when yesterday I talked about taming, rite, child or something other.

Seem thing happened over and over again during those years, I'm always thunderstruck by my work before. I know, actually, I just put them down for a while, then they 're all gone.

If you don't want to forget something, just do a mark, wherever you like, calendars, diaries, blogs, etc. And don't lost them. Never trust one's memory, just put them in paper, write down and try not to forget.

And when I write and write again, I write something I never thought before, seem like something happened naturally by logic. I never have a logic exercise and those was been called nothing matters about Chinese GaoKao....

We know that the deep mind will show you only when you convert it to mind, (by a book???) And I like use this way to discover my deep mind and try to change my strange character.
