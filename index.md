Welcome my second brain I tried to build with [obsidian](obsidian) & [quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz). I used to build with [logseq-logseq](logseq-logseq.md) before, but now I [give it up](1218-giving-up-logseq), which is the reason why some part of notes is ugly and wired.[^giving-up-logseq]

Anyway, wish you have a fun time, with following categories by [[notes-philosophy|my category philosophy]]:

- [Weekly](weekly/index)
- [Projects](projects/index)
- [Configuration](custom/index)
- [Skills](skills/index)
- [Devices](devices/index)

That would be my pleasure. ðŸ˜Š

[^giving-up-logseq]:: two formats would be existed on here: outliner & paragraph.
