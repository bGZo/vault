# Json

## What

- 通过键来引用值
- a lightweight data interchange format
- is language independent
- The JSON format is **syntactically** identical to the code for **creating JavaScript objects**. Because of this similarity, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into native JavaScript objects.(JavaScript 语法支持, 语法糖)

## Basic Data Type (5)

### Number

- a signed decimal number that may contain a fractional part and may use exponential [E notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_notation), but cannot include non-numbers such as [NaN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN).
- The format makes no distinction between integer and floating-point.
- JavaScript uses a [double-precision floating-point format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format) for all its numeric values, but other languages implementing JSON may encode numbers differently.

### String

- a sequence of zero or more [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) characters.
- Strings are delimited with double-quotation marks and support a backslash [escaping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character) syntax.

### Boolean

- either of the values `true` or `false`

### Array

- an [ordered list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(abstract_data_type)) of zero or more values, each of which may be of any type.
- Arrays use [square bracket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_bracket) notation with comma-separated elements.

### Object

- a collection of [name–value pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute%E2%80%93value_pair) where the names (also called keys) are strings.
- Objects are intended to represent [associative arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array), where each key is unique within an object.
- Objects are delimited with [curly brackets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braces_(punctuation)#Braces) and use commas to separate each pair, while within each pair the colon ':' character separates the key or name from its value.

### More

- `null`
	- an empty value, using the word `null`
- Whitespace is allowed and ignored around or between syntactic elements (values and punctuation, but not within a string value). Four specific characters are considered whitespace for this purpose: space, horizontal tab, line feed, and carriage return. In particular, the byte order mark must not be generated by a conforming implementation (though it may be accepted when parsing JSON). JSON does not provide syntax for comments.
- Early versions of JSON (such as specified by RFC 4627) required that a valid JSON text must consist of only an object or an array type, which could contain other types within them. This restriction was dropped in RFC 7158, where a JSON text was remark: d as any serialized value.

## Vs 字典

字典是对 Hash Table 这一数据结构的一种实现, 它使用其内置的哈希函数来规划键对应的内容的储存位置，从而获得 O(1) 的数据读取速度
