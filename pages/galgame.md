# Galgame

## Why

I know this kind of game from [*Oreimo*](https://bgm.tv/subject/5436), and I'm really drawn to it. I used to treat it like an alternative to anime, basically it's same except a little complex.

Then I know there is rating system for arts, expecially R18 game, which I almost have no education to sex. So I was addiacted in it deeper, and then find it's nothing if the story is bad.

A lot of things happened in china Internet, such as the policy is changed (to be more restrict, filling with recopy, report ( (⌈终焉无脑韛 - 单推水巴⌋ 举报汉化到柚子社 ) and sell again), Chinese translation group disbanded appear more and more ([[chinese-translation-group|汉化组]]).

Simply speaking, the whole market is exposed outside and turned to legal. Things is not turn good way to develop, because the rule of censor is not public. So I never touched a domestic galgame till now, because I don't think how deep in some topic they could reach, and that matters.

Yet the most friendly platform is steam, but they have the censor as well, including child porn or something else, which is different with Japan. I doubt, does it make sense? I don't know. I just dream a platform, which could give me all I want. But seemly it's just a dream. (See [[~「统计」一些STEAM未能过审的GAL作品整理|「统计」一些 STEAM 未能过审的 GAL 作品整理]])

In broad strokes, I devided it into two categories now, althougt they have more details. (See [[#Categories]])

- galgame/jerk-off (See [[hentai]])
- galgame/god

## ~~Should I build each page for every single galgame? Just like book, Is that necessary? ~~

- ~~Pointful~~ Meaningful? @20221121
- **Unlike book**, they wont have a single page
- But if, one day, the discuss about origin game increased a huge amount. I will turn it to page. But now, I just record the name I played, I don't have too interest and energy in it. \#changelog/wiki
- ==In a way, this is a decide about hierarchy for content, or just for category?==
- And this decision is not limited to galgame, more adopt to items of 2022, like hobby / archive. If they're huge, turn it to page, not build a single page immediately.
