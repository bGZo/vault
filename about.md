# About

Welcome my second brain build with [[obsidian]] & [[jackyzha0-quartz|quartz]]. I used to build with [[logseq-logseq|logseq]] before, but now I [[1218-giving-up-logseq|Giving up Logseq]] , which is the reason why some part of notes is ugly and wired.[^giving-up-logseq]

Anyway, wish you have a fun time, with following categories by [[notes-philosophy|my category philosophy]]

That would be my pleasure. ðŸ˜Š

## Structure / Design

- (Submodule) Assets sepreated via: https://github.com/bGZo/assets
- (Submodule) CLipper / export contents via: https://github.com/bGZo/clippers
    - This repo only focus on individual expression. So no more other contents include any more.

## Roadmap

> I hope all my public expression can be centralized in this repo.

- [ ] Kill https://github.com/bgzo/blog.
- [x] Kill https://www.cnblogs.com
	- Weekly expression could be convert traditional Chinese.
- MicroBlog have to use [[telegramdesktop-tdesktop|telegram]]
