# Copyright

借由赋予对著作的专有权利的方式提供作者从事创作之经济动机，但相对的此种赋予作者专有权利的方式同时也限制了他人任意使用创作物的自由

> 创作一分钟, 版权一小时.

## Why

## How

> Almost everything on the Internet has some sort of copyright attached to it. Whether these **things are watermarked, signed, or have any other sort of indication of the copyright is a different story** however.
> via: [Copyright - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright)

==似乎打水印和版权保护真的没有什么关系, 我最原始的目的就是署名, 至于是否盈利, 现在我还没有太多的考量==
