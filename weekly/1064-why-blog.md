# Why blog today

## Remember[^memory-disappear]

[^memory-disappear]: 表达欲是有窗口期的，很多不愿忘记的想法和感受，就得马上写下来，要不然过段时间回忆不起来会更加难受。但表达总是有成本的，各个记录的媒介代价不一，文字，录音，照片，影像，甚至是现在的 AI 每种媒介都有自己的分野，侧重点不同。我比较古板，还是喜欢写文章，因为它几乎是所有媒介剔骨去肉留下的最终产物。

After I read [[~the-little-prince|The Little Prince]], I relieved I've forgotten for a long time about rite. But it's seem like when yesterday I talked about taming, rite, child or something other.

Seem thing happened over and over again during those years, I'm always thunderstruck by my work before. I know, actually, I just put them down for a while, then they 're all gone.

If you don't want to forget something, just do a mark, wherever you like, calendars, diaries, blogs, etc. And don't lost them. Never trust one's memory, just put them in paper, write down and try not to forget.

## Save yourself

Actually, when I read senior high school, I was always alone. Sometime I created a virtual people talking with myself, writing letter to myself. And when I write and write again, I write something I never thought before, seem like something happened naturally by logic. I never have a logic exercise and those was been called nothing matters about Chinese GaoKao....

We know that the deep mind will show you only when you convert it to mind, (by a book???) And I like use this way to discover my deep mind and try to change my strange character.

## Introduce yourself
