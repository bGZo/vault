# Years

## Why

复盘

## How

- 基本每一个平台都会有年度总结, 如果我要聚合所有的平台的链接, 那会永无止境, 我只能在入门的时候多看看这个平台的年度数据. Especially [[hobby]]
	- You know what, actually I don't give a fuck to this garbage ranking.
	- Only when **you are newer to fields or you are busy all years**, you would need this.

### 原则: Not New Year Resolution, but Past Year Review(PYR)

- 狗熊有话说 [ep. 400](https://voice.beartalking.com/400) 讲 [@Tim Ferriss](https://tim.blog/2021/12/27/past-year-review/) 的方法: **不要着急做做新一年的计划, 而是去回看过去一年的经历**. 以及以下的方法论

1. Grab a notepad and create two columns: POSITIVE and NEGATIVE.
2. Go through your calendar from the last year, looking at every week.
3. For each week, jot down on the pad any people or activities or commitments that triggered peak positive or negative emotions for that month. Put them in their respective columns.
4. Once you’ve gone through the past year, look at your notepad list and ask, “What 20% of each column produced the most reliable or powerful peaks?”
5. Based on the answers, take your “positive” leaders and schedule more of them in the new year. Get them on the calendar now! Book things with friends and prepay for activities/events/commitments that you know work. It’s not real until it’s in the calendar. That’s step one. Step two is to take your “negative” leaders, put “NOT-TO-DO LIST” at the top, and put them somewhere you can see them each morning for the first few weeks of 2022. These are the people and things you *know* make you miserable, so don’t put them on your calendar out of obligation, guilt, FOMO, or other nonsense.
