ðŸ‘‹ Hello there.

My name is Fenghua, using `bGZo` as nickname on Internet.

I'm a software engineer focus on Java develop. I love open-source, command-line.

I love reading (literature, philosophy, non-fiction), animes, podcasts, pixel arts and instrumental musics as well. If you're, wish we could be friends : )
