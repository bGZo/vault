ðŸ‘‹ Hello there.

My name is Fenghua, using `bGZo` as nickname on Internet.

I love open-source, command-line, creating tools to improve productivity. Recently I focus on Java develop. So any problem welcome to communicate with me.

I'm a software engineer, but I love literature.

Except above, I love coffee, reading (philosophy, non-fiction most), animes, podcasts, pixel arts and instrumental musics as well. If you're, wish we could be friends : )
