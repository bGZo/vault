# 结构化编程

- improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of the structured control flow constructs of selection (if/then/else) and repetition (while and for), block structures, and subroutines.
- The **structured program theorem** provides the theoretical basis of structured programming.
	- It states that three ways of combining programs—sequencing, selection, and iteration—are sufficient to express any computable function.
	- This observation did not originate with the structured programming movement; these structures are sufficient to describe the instruction cycle of a central processing unit, as well as the operation of a Turing machine.
