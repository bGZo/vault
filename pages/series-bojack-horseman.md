> "You're a good person，Dlane，and that's the most important thing，it's important that you don't stop being good.I like how you always bring your own bags to the grocery store，and how you're always organized to go places，I like how you chew gum on the airplane so your ears will pop.A lot of people might not appreciate that about you，but 1do.

> I was embarrassed by the person l was when I was staying with you. I'm trying not to be that person.I'm just trying to get through.each day. I can't keep asking myself，"Am I happy？Am I happy？It just makes me more miserable.I donft know if I believe in it，real lasting happiness.All those perky，well-adjusted people you see in movies and TV shows？I don't think they exist .-No one's happy all the time，
