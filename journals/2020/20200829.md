其实多年后猛地回头去看，才会发现记忆里阴暗角落里的窃笑大多是自己夸大的臆想。 自己如果可以把重心放回自己，过去某些挥之不去的阴影，撞不破的南墙从某种角度来看亦可破之。

你总觉得别人在批评、否定、指责自己，因此自己犹犹豫豫，寸步难行，然而你观察现实世界发现，似乎没有一个人对自己说过严重的话。或者，即便有，也只是偶尔，但是你却感觉那些话永远萦绕在你心头，而且本来轻轻的话语，在你心中却掀起了惊涛骇浪……
这只是因为，那个永远在严厉地批评、否定、指责自己的，是你自己。
先看到这一点，再试着去看到另一个事实——周围有人在夸奖、肯定和支持自己，试着也把这些声音吸纳进来。

人在安静时想起自己所有的亏欠，重要的不是做什么，而是认识到你是谁。想起了奥古斯丁教导：“坏习惯不加以抑制，不久它就会变成你生活上的必需品了。”“我们最危险的敌人其实是我们对敌人的仇恨，这种仇恨在我们内心造成的伤害，远远超过我们打击敌人给敌人造成的伤害。
