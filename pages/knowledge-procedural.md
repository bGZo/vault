# 过程型知识

  - Know how to perform some task, including knowing how to perform it skillfully. Such as **how to ride a bike, how to drive a car, or how to use computer, etc**.
  - [[knowledge-procedural]] #vs [[knowledge-declarative]]
    - For Ryle in his book *The Concept of Mind*
      - knowing-how differs in its **emphasis and purpose(重点和目的)**, since it is primarily practical knowledge, whereas the know-that focuses on **indicative or explanatory knowledge(指示性或解释性知识)**.
    - A person doesn't need to be able to verbally articulate their procedural knowledge in order for it to count as knowledge, since procedural knowledge requires only knowing how to correctly perform an action or exercise a skill. （不用说清，只管做就好）
      - verbally ：by means of words
- Development
  - 比如失忆患者可以拿到使用技能的权力, 但是其无法说出个所以然来, 他并不知道做这个能力的很多理论知识, 他就是会做.
- Technical uses of the phrase
  - In the classroom, procedural knowledge is part of the prior knowledge of a student.
