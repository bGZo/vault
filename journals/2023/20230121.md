  - I told myself again and again, so I could come here.
    - First of all, I have a pity with my mother. After all it's not her fault, she do her best in my daily family and she just have some tired with increasing ages. She complexed with us, just because she want some support. She can't take any more sometimes.
      - I know this feeling that I have no way to escape. My back is black, I have to push myself, do stuff boring again and again. Life shouldn't be like this. Never, ever.
    - Then, in my deep feeling, I don't want to have a wired atmosphere with my family. I don't like play tricks between us. It's tired. I don't want to be a collaborator of stench and lazy. Clearly, I want a warm family. I want empathy, sincere help and enough support between us.

All said, "Gender Equality", but in my situation, it's a joke, tell me why always is me? I cannot figure it out. Just because she is a girl, so she could escape this simple task?

- I register community in #china is just want to get the contents. I would contribute anything but fetch. I hate #censor and being taken #privacy

- 今年看到网上小确幸自己被大厂捞的, 真的起步就是本 9, 都没看到个 211 出来秀的. 操他妈的
  - 本以为跑到同好圈就能安静地当只鸵鸟，可谁知，同好圈里也有人源源不断的歌颂现实生活的小确幸。怎么办？好焦虑。搜索，翻看，对比，更加焦虑，花费了巨大的时间却无法平静，我才意识到，躲在社交媒体后充耳不闻无济于事，像是这操蛋的生活，本就无处可躲。整日昏睡也好，破罐破摔也好，抑或惶惶不可终日，唯有抽离，俯瞰，Think Again 能让我好受一点。

- 生活依旧, 思考被自动舍弃 #fuck-reality

  - 我的恋人, 好像我再度失去了生活, 不知不觉中, 我又开始习惯了熬夜, 晚上也无所顾忌地喝起了咖啡, 不再给自己设早上的闹钟, 也不再固执早起半小时做早饭, 多一顿少一顿好像也没差.
  - 不再想现实生活的糟心事, 不再看书, 不再听播客, 不再画画, 整日把自己埋在的充满视觉刺激的艺术作品中, 直到意识模糊, 然后闭上眼睛, 又是一天.
  - 一天混沌中, 做的最规律的事情可能就是按时吃饭, 到点洗漱, 给猫猫换水, 刷刷朋友圈, 也许明日依旧, 我想, 生活并没有把我抛弃, 我还有心跳, 还有温度, 还有今天醒来前, 睡梦中鲜活的你, 这难道不是生活吗?
  - 我只是停止了思考, 开始随波逐流, 迷茫, 也不去想, 也不去做具体的事, 我不知道未来会更好, 还是更坏, 好像什么都不做就是最优解, 呆在自己的同温层中, 什么也不做, 仿佛一切都还有周旋的余地, 但是时光飞逝, 不作为本身, 不就是一种蹉跎的罪吗?
  - 我不知道, 我停止了思考.
