# Thinking

## Thinking vs [[thought]]

==Thought is more than a thinking==, 它可大可小, thought 之间转化的过程需要用到 thinking,

> thought is one step at a time and these various steps makes up thinking
> But when understood in the widest sense, **any mental event may be understood as a form of thinking, including perception and unconscious mental processes**. In a slightly different sense, the term *thought* refers not to the mental processes themselves but to mental states or systems of ideas brought about by these processes.

> 但从最广义上理解时，任何心理事件都可以理解为一种思维形式，包括知觉和无意识的心理过程。在稍微不同的意义上，*思想这个词*不是指心理过程本身，而是指由这些过程引起的心理状态或思想体系
